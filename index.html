            <h2>THE VERY BEST FOR BETTA FISH</h2>
            <p>
                    The Siamese fighting fish, also known as the Betta, 
                    is a popular fish in the aquarium trade. Bettas are a 
                    member of the gourami family and are known to be highly 
                    territorial. Males in particular are prone to high levels 
                    of aggression and will attack each other if housed in the
                    same tank. If there is no means of escape, this will 
                    usually result in the death of one or both of the fish. 
                    Female bettas can also become territorial towards each 
                    other if they are housed in too small an aquarium. 
                    It is typically not recommended to keep male and female 
                    bettas together, except temporarily for breeding purposes 
                    which should always be undertaken with caution.
